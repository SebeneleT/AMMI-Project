# AMMI-Project

Repository containing code to reproduce experiments conducted for AMMI project.

The code contains two implementations of the 2D Poisson Equation approximation using Physics Informed Neural Networks
# Simple Implementation

Simple implementation done in a few lines specifically for solving the 2D poisson equation. To run code, download file and run.

# General Implementation

Code can be adapted for various different equations of varying dimensionality. To run code download file and run PINNS_alg.py.
